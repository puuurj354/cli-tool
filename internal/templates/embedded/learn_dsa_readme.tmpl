# Data Structures & Algorithms Practice

Practice implementing common data structures and algorithms in Go.

## Structure

```
datastructures/
├── stack/       # Stack implementation
├── queue/       # Queue implementation
├── linkedlist/  # Linked List implementation
└── tree/        # Binary Tree (coming soon)

algorithms/
├── sorting/     # Sorting algorithms
├── searching/   # Searching algorithms
└── recursion/   # Recursive problems
```

## How to Practice

1. Open any `*_test.go` file to see the expected behavior
2. Implement the functions in the corresponding `.go` file
3. Run tests: `go test ./...`

## Quick Commands

```bash" + `
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run tests with verbose output
go test -v ./...

# Run specific package tests
go test -v ./datastructures/stack/
go test -v ./algorithms/sorting/
```
