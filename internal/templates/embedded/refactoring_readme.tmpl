# Refactoring Exercises 🔧

Practice improving code quality through refactoring!

## How to Use

1. Look at `before.go` in each exercise folder
2. Identify the code smells
3. Read `hints.md` for guidance
4. Create `after.go` with your refactored version
5. Make sure the functionality stays the same!

## Exercises

### 01 - Long Function
A function that does too many things. Break it down!

### 02 - Magic Numbers
Numbers without context. Give them names!

### 03 - Poor Naming
Variables and functions with unclear names. Make them descriptive!

## Tips

- Make small, incremental changes
- Run tests after each change
- Focus on readability
- Follow Go conventions

Happy refactoring! 🧹
