# Algorithm Challenges

This template generates 3 algorithm problems (Easy, Medium, Hard) similar to those found in coding interviews (LeetCode style).

## How to use

1. Go to the challenge folder (e.g., `easy`, `medium`, `hard`).
2. Open the `.go` file.
3. Read the problem description in the comments.
4. Implement the function where it says `TODO`.
5. Run the tests to verify your solution.

```bash
cd easy
go test -v
```

## Structure

- **easy/main.go**: Two Sum
- **medium/main.go**: LRU Cache
- **hard/main.go**: Merge K Sorted Lists

Good luck!
