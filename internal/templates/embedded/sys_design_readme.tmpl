# System Design Exercise

This template provides a framework for practicing System Design.

## Task
Design a **URL Shortener** system.

## Steps

1. **Fill out the Design Doc**: Open `design-docs/url-shortener.md` and complete the sections. Think about trade-offs, scalability, and data modeling.
2. **Define Interfaces**: Open `prototypes/main.go` and define the Go interfaces that would make up your system. We've started this for you.
3. **Draft Implementation**: (Optional) Try to implement a basic in-memory version in Go to see if your interfaces hold up.
