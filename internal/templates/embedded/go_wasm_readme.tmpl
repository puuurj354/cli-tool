Experimental **WebAssembly** application using Go.

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.21+

## Getting Started

1. **Build the WASM binary**:
   (This also copies the necessary `wasm_exec.js` from your Go installation)
   ```bash
   make build
   ```

2. **Serve the application**:
   ```bash
   make serve
   ```

3. Open browser at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## How it works

- `main.go`: The Go code compiled to WebAssembly. interacting with JS via `syscall/js`.
- `server.go`: A simple HTTP server ensuring `.wasm` files are served with the correct `application/wasm` Content-Type.
- `index.html`: Loads the `wasm_exec.js` shim and instantiates the WASM module.
