# Hints for Exercise 02: Magic Numbers

## Code Smells
1. Numbers like 0.5, 1.5, 100, 50, 8, 128 have no context
2. Priority 1, 2, 3 are unclear
3. Discount codes are hardcoded

## Suggested Refactoring

### Step 1: Define Constants for Shipping
```go" + `
const (
    BaseRatePerKg     = 0.5
    LongDistanceThreshold  = 100.0
    MediumDistanceThreshold = 50.0
    LongDistanceMultiplier  = 1.5
    MediumDistanceMultiplier = 1.25
    MinShippingCost = 5.0
    MaxShippingCost = 500.0
)
```

### Step 2: Use Named Constants for Priority
```go" + `
const (
    PriorityExpress  = 1
    PriorityFast     = 2
    PriorityStandard = 3
)

var priorityMultipliers = map[int]float64{
    PriorityExpress:  3.0,
    PriorityFast:     2.0,
    PriorityStandard: 1.5,
}
```

### Step 3: Define Password Constraints
```go" + `
const (
    MinPasswordLength = 8
    MaxPasswordLength = 128
)
```

### Step 4: Use a Discounts Map
```go" + `
var discounts = map[string]float64{
    "SAVE10": 0.10,
    "SAVE20": 0.20,
    "HALF":   0.50,
}
```

## Benefits
- Self-documenting code
- Easy to change values in one place
- Prevents typos with repeated numbers
- More readable conditions
