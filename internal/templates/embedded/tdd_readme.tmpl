# Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Go

Learn the TDD workflow: **Red → Green → Refactor**

## 📁 Directory Structure

| Directory | Topic |
|-----------|-------|
| `01-red-green-refactor/` | Core TDD cycle with calculator |
| `02-mocking/` | Interfaces and test doubles |
| `03-refactoring/` | Safe refactoring with tests |
| `04-bdd-style/` | Given/When/Then pattern |
| `05-exercises/` | Practice problems |

## 🔴🟢🔵 The TDD Cycle

```
1. RED    → Write a failing test
2. GREEN  → Write minimal code to pass
3. REFACTOR → Improve code without breaking tests
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./... -v

# Run with coverage
go test ./... -cover

# Run specific module
cd 01-red-green-refactor && go test -v
```

## 📚 Learning Path

1. **Red-Green-Refactor** - Master the core cycle
2. **Mocking** - Test code with external dependencies
3. **Refactoring** - Safely improve code structure
4. **BDD-style** - Write readable test scenarios
5. **Exercises** - Practice with real problems
